# Road_Traffic_Accident_Classification

Welcome to the Road Traffic Accident Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This project aims to analyze road traffic accident data to derive insights and make data-driven decisions to improve road safety. The dataset includes features such as the number of vehicles involved, accident severity, casualties, and time of the accident.

#### Key Features:
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Detailed examination of traffic accident characteristics.
- Correlation Analysis: Investigation of relationships between different features.
- Model Evaluation: Comparison of various machine learning models to predict accident severity.
#### Findings:
- Strong correlations between the number of vehicles involved and accident severity.
- Evaluation of multiple machine learning models with Decision Tree Classifier performing the best.
#### Recommendations:
- Focus on improving road safety by targeting high-risk features identified in the analysis.
- Consider further analysis with additional data or different modeling techniques for better predictions.
